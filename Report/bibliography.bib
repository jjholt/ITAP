	abstract = {A continuous wave technique is described for measuring the nine independent orthotropic elastic coefficients from a single small cubic specimen. The side dimensions of this cubic specimen are on the order of 5 mm. Because of the small size of the specimen, the spatial resolution of material inhomogeneity using this technique is quite good. Although it is possible to apply this technique to any elastic material such as woods or metals, the elastic properties of human and canine cortical femora are presented here. The orthotropic elastic coefficients and the variation of these coefficients are presented as a function of anatomical position.},

This study validated a finite element (in silico) model based on an ITAP design and investigated implant stem stiffness influence on periprosthetic femoral bone strain. Results showed good agreement in the validation of the in silico model against the in vitro results using uniaxial strain gauges and Digital Image Correlation (DIC). Using Strain Energy Density (SED) thresholds as the stimulus for adaptive bone remodelling, the validated model illustrated that: (a) bone apposition increased and resorption decreased with increasing implant stem flexibility in early stance; (b) bone apposition decreased (mean change = − 9.8\%) and resorption increased (mean change = 20.3\%) from distal to proximal in most stem stiffness models in early stance. By engineering the flow of force through the implant/bone (e.g. by changing material properties) these results demonstrate how periprosthetic bone remodelling, thus aseptic loosening, can be managed. This paper finds that future implant designs should be optimised for bone strain under a variety of relevant loading conditions using finite element models to maximise the chances of clinical success.},

	abstract = {Background
In many published studies, elastic properties of bone are correlated to the bone density, in order to derive an empirical elasticity–density relationship. The most common use of these relationships is the prediction of the bone local properties from medical imaging data in subject-specific numerical simulation studies. The proposed relationships are substantially different one from the other. It is unclear whether such differences in elasticity–density relationships can be entirely explained in terms of methodological discrepancies among studies.
Methods
All relevant literature was reviewed. Only elasticity–density relationships derived from similarly controlled experiments were included and properly normalized. The resulting relationships were grouped according to the most important methodological differences: type of end support during testing, specimen geometry, and anatomical sampling location.
Findings
Even after normalization with respect to strain rate and densitometric measurement unit, substantial inter-study differences do exist, and they can only be partially explained by the methodological differences between studies.
Interpretation
Some recommendations are made for the application of elasticity–density relationships to subject-specific finite element studies. The importance of defining a standardized mechanical testing methodology for bone specimens is stressed, and some guidelines that emerged from the literature are proposed. To identify density–elasticity relationships suitable for use in subject-specific FE studies, the development of a benchmark study is also proposed, where the elasticity–density relationship is taken as the variable under study, and a numerical model of known numerical accuracy predicts experimental strain measurements.},

	abstract = {Biomechanics deals with the study of mechanical aspects of biological objects. Humerus is the bone present in human hand which extends from the shoulder joint up to the elbow joint. The main reason behind this study is to examine the changes in the modal frequency of humerus bone for different materials. In this study we apply different loads on the humerus bone fixing the proximal (upper end) and applying 850 N load on the distal side (lower end) and note down the Modal frequencies for different materials. From this we get to know about the Modal frequency at which the bone fails. Model is prepared using ITK-Snap software. MSC Patran software is used for preprocessing and post processing whereas MSC Nastran is used as solver. Analysis is carried out for three different materials, natural bone, AZ31 and CP-Ti. It is found that 0.095 Hz–0.451 Hz is the modal frequency of natural bone. Modal frequency of AZ31 is 0.184 Hz–0.871 Hz and Modal frequency of CPTi is 0.29 Hz–1.36 Hz. These modal frequencies do not exceed the natural frequency of the bone materials. As far as Bone implants are concerned, AZ31 is best and this will be absorbed by the body and no further surgery is required. The stress and displacement are comparatively minimum for this material and it is lighter in weight as compared to CP-Ti. The manufacturing cost is also minimal.},

	abstract = {There is growing evidence that focal thinning of cortical bone in the proximal femur may predispose a hip to fracture. Detecting such defects in clinical CT is challenging, since cortices may be significantly thinner than the imaging system’s point spread function. We recently proposed a model-fitting technique to measure sub-millimetre cortices, an ill-posed problem which was regularized by assuming a specific, fixed value for the cortical density. In this paper, we develop the work further by proposing and evaluating a more rigorous method for estimating the constant cortical density, and extend the paradigm to encompass the mapping of cortical mass (mineral mg/cm2) in addition to thickness. Density, thickness and mass estimates are evaluated on sixteen cadaveric femurs, with high resolution measurements from a micro-CT scanner providing the gold standard. The results demonstrate robust, accurate measurement of peak cortical density and cortical mass. Cortical thickness errors are confined to regions of thin cortex and are bounded by the extent to which the local density deviates from the peak, averaging 20\% for 0.5 mm cortex.},

The classic strategy of calculating the Young's modulus from an average element density and the one that averages the Young's moduli directly derived from each voxel Hounsfield Unit were considered. These strategies were applied to the finite element model of a real human femur. The accuracy of the superficial stress and strain predictions was evaluated against experimentally measured values in 13 strain-gauge locations for five different loading conditions. The results obtained for the two material distributions were statistically different. Both models predicted very accurately the superficial stresses, with regression coefficients higher than 0.9 and slopes not significantly different from unity. The second strategy definitely improved the strains prediction accuracy: the regression coefficient raised from 0.69 to 0.79; the average and peak errors decreased from 45.1\% to 31.3\% and from 228\% to 134\% of the maximum measured strain, respectively. The stress fields predicted inside the bone were also significantly different. A new software implementing the second strategy was made available in the public domain.},

	abstract = {Despite evidence of the biomechanical role of cortical bone, current state of the art finite element models of the proximal femur built from clinical CT data lack a subject-specific representation of the bone cortex. Our main research hypothesis is that the subject-specific modelling of cortical bone layer from CT images, through a deconvolution procedure known as Cortical Bone Mapping (CBM, validated for cortical thickness and density estimates) can improve the accuracy of CT-based FE models of the proximal femur, currently limited by partial volume artefacts. Our secondary hypothesis is that a careful choice of cortical-specific density-elasticity relationship may improve model accuracy. We therefore: (i) implemented a procedure to include subject-specific CBM estimates of both cortical thickness and density in CT-based FE models. (ii) defined alternative models that included CBM estimates and featured a cortical-specific or an independently optimised density-elasticity relationship. (iii) tested our hypotheses in terms of elastic strain estimates and failure load and location prediction, by comparing with a published cohort of 14 femurs, where strain and strength in stance and fall loading configuration were experimentally measured, and estimated through reference FE models that did not explicitly model the cortical compartment. Our findings support the main hypothesis: an explicit modelling of the proximal femur cortical bone layer including CBM estimates of cortical bone thickness and density increased the FE strains prediction, mostly by reducing peak errors (average error reduced by 30\%, maximum error and 95th percentile of error distribution halved) and especially when focusing on the femoral neck locations (all error metrics at least halved). We instead rejected the secondary hypothesis: changes in cortical density-elasticity relationship could not improve validation performances. From these improved baseline strain estimates, further work is needed to achieve accurate strength predictions, as models incorporating cortical thickness and density produced worse estimates of failure load and equivalent estimates of failure location when compared to reference models. In summary, we recommend including local estimates of cortical thickness and density in FE models to estimate bone strains in physiological conditions, and especially when designing exercise studies to promote bone strength.},
